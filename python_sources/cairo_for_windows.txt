Running pip install cairo might not work on Windows OS.
To install the Cairo package, a wheel has to be compiled from the source code of Cairo.
An alternative is to download Cairo wheel corresponding with a processor of the computer.
This wheel can be downloaded at https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygtk
Then install from the wheel: python -m pip install wheel.whl.
